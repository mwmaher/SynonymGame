# SynonymGame
The SynonymGame is a game developed in Python by Michael W. Maher. 

Executing the code:
python "SynonymGame.py"

Object of the Game:
The objective of the game is to correctly identify as many synonyms as possible in a given round of play. Each correct answer during the round earns points. A total score is given at the end of the round.

Target audience:
This is a great little game for people that enjoy word games.  Play it to help improve your vocabulary or keep your mind sharp.  It is also a fun way to help a college-bound high-school student prepare for the SAT or ACT.  English learners will benefit from playing the game by improving their command of the language.

Python coding notes:
- Incorprates a web-based theasurus via an API
