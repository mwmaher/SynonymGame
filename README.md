# SynonymGame
The SynonymGame is a game developed in Python by Michael W. Maher. 

Executing the code:
python "SynonymGame.py"

Object of the Game:
The objective of the game is to correctly identify as many synonyms as possible in a given round of play to maximize your score. Each correct answer during the round earns points. A total score is given at the end of the round.

Scoring:
A correct answer earns 10 points + 1 point for each letter of the word and your answer.  This means that longer words earn more points.

Target audience:
This is a great little game for people that enjoy word games.  Play it to help improve your vocabulary or keep your mind sharp.  It is also a fun way to help a college-bound high-school student prepare for the SAT or ACT.  English learners will benefit from playing the game by improving their command of the language.

Python coding notes:
- Utilizes a RESTful web-based thesurus via an API
- Utilizes JSON to retrieve synonyms from the thesurus
- Code takes into account that not all words will be in the thesaurus and not all words will have synonyms.  Only words in the thesaurus and having synonyms are presented to players.
- You will need your own key from http://words.bighugelabs.com/getkey.php'
- Save the key text as the only contents in a file called, "bighugelabskey.txt"

Feedback:
Your comments and feedback are welcome.  I would love to hear from you if you give this game a try.
